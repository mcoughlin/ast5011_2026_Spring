    "\n",
    "Over the next several lectures we will explore another major component of stellar microphysics: the **equation of state (EOS)**. In general, the EOS specifies the pressure as a function of density, temperature, and composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P = P(\\rho, T, X_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Its most direct appearance in stellar structure is through the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\rho \\frac{G M(r)}{r^2}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "where we used the equation of HSE to simplify. Also, sometimes the pressure scale height is defined as $H_{\\rm{P}}$ with value of order unity in the constant-density model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider also the mean free path $\\lambda_{\\rm{phot}}$ of a photon, or the distance traveled by a photon before it is either absorbed or scattered in a new direction:\n",
