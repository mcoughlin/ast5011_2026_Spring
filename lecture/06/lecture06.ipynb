However, there is a limit to how steep the temperature gradient can be while still allowing energy to be transported stably. If this limit is exceeded, an instability sets in, leading to cyclic macroscopic motions of the gas, known as convection.\n",

    "1. A parcel has a characteristic size comparable to the mixing length $\\ell$.\n",
    "2. The mixing length is shorter than any scale length associated with the stellar structure, e.g., the pressure scale height $H_{\\rm P}$: in practice, $\\ell \\sim H_{\\rm P}$.\n",
